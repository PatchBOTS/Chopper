### Please Read Before Downloading 3D Files

## Overview

This is going to where I post up all the 3D files for Chopper. When I finish the functionality of the droid I will post all files up to that point before moving onto the aesthetics. 


## 3D Files
The 3D files are free for download. I'm happy to distribute these files for free but they are not guaranteed to work. 
I'm not doing any Beta testing or revision beyond my initial prints.  This isn't an "offical" release in anyway, these are just the files I used and worked with which I am sharing for other builders.  Any time/money/filament/sanity lost due to something not working is a risk you have to take before downloading these files.  

## KNOWN ISSUES
This project has been ongoing for a long time. Somewhere in the middle I did a major calibration on the main printer I was using because i was noticing the dimensional accuracy was off.  This is leading to issues with new parts fitting into the frame.  I will try to address this before the final release, but know that things may require trimming or shimming or both.  At least until I can go in and rework the whole the fiel, which realistically probably won't happen any time soon. I will try to document this more specifically in the full release.
